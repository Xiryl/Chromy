### What is?
Chromy is a tool that help you to **dump**, **view** or **delete** your local chrome **password** database.

### It's Secure?
**YES**
All the source code is available here. You can edit as you want to make it better sending a *pull request*. 
You can view the license first. Obviusly I take no responsibility for the indiscreet use of this program.

### Why I Need To Use It?
Because chrome password manager is **Really Unsecure!**
